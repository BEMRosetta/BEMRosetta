# BEMRosetta Install

## Binaries

### Windows
No compiling is required. Just go to the [last release](https://github.com/BEMRosetta/BEMRosetta/releases), copy bin/BEMRosetta.exe and bin/BEMRosetta_cl.exe anywhere in your computer and dodge Windows warnings. 

## Compiling

BEMRosetta is proudly developed with the [U++ framework](https://www.ultimatepp.org/) using the C++ language. 
U++ makes C++ so simple and efficient that it appeals even to scripting language programmers.

U++ is simple to [install](https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$download$en-us.html). Uninstalling it is just a matter of deleting the install folder. 

To compile BEMRosetta, open theide (the U++ IDE), choose in the right the "MyApps" assembly, and tap on UppHub:
