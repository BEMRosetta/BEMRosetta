[This short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMt0QTr-3SI) describes the steps. 

No compiling is required. Just go to the [last release](https://github.com/BEMRosetta/BEMRosetta/releases), copy bin/BEMRosetta.exe and bin/BEMRosetta_cl.exe anywhere in your computer and dodge Windows warnings. 

## GNU/Linux Compiling

[This short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGCHyuXHa4) describes the steps.

BEMRosetta is proudly developed with the [U++ framework](https://www.ultimatepp.org/) using the C++ language. 
U++ makes C++ so simple and efficient that it appeals even to scripting language programmers.

U++ is simple to [install](https://www.ultimatepp.org/www$uppweb$download$en-us.html). Uninstalling it is just a matter of deleting the install folder. 

To compile BEMRosetta, open TheIDE (the U++ IDE), choose in the right the "MyApps" assembly, and tap on UppHub:

Of course, there are much more advanced options, but to go further it is better to learn [TheIDE](https://www.ultimatepp.org/app$ide$GettingStarted$en-us.html).
